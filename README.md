#Avishkar Hyperloop Control Center
This project is a web application built using Streamlit that serves as a control center for monitoring and managing the Avishkar Hyperloop pods. It allows users to track pod performance, view real-time data, and analyze various metrics.
##My Approach
I began by exploring the Streamlit documentation to understand its features and components. This helped me grasp the basics of building interactive applications. Afterward, I followed a few tutorials to gain hands-on experience and learn how to integrate data visualization and interactivity effectively. Finally, I used ChatGPT to troubleshoot issues, generate ideas, and optimize my code whenever I encountered challenges.
Features
##Pod Tracker: Search and filter pods by name or status, and sort them based on metrics like speed or battery level.
Interactive Map: Displays pod locations using Folium for better visualization.
Weather Integration: Provides weather conditions at pod locations.
##Pod Comparison: Compare performance metrics between two pods side by side.
Technologies Used
Streamlit: For building the web app interface.
Pandas: For data manipulation.
Folium: For map visualization.
Custom CSS: To enhance the UI/UX design.
#How to Run
